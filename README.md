#Schul-Zeugnis-Ersteller (sze). [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opensource21/sze.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opensource21/sze)
sze is a German Schul-Zeugnis-Erstellungs program.
I guess that it will be so special for the German school, that I decide to
make it as simple as possible, so no internationalization is planned and
the complete documentation will be in German.
You can get more information in German in the [Wiki](https://github.com/opensource21/sze/wiki).
If you read the source-code to proof the quality, please have in mind that
it is a spare-time project, so sometime it's quickly hacked just to get finished.
Furthermore the test coverage is low. However the program is used and there
was till now only a few errors in production, which could be quickly fixed.

Die Dokumentation findet sich im [Wiki](https://github.com/opensource21/sze/wiki)
